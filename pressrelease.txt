FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Austin, TX) -

BeastmAlster is a classification model for identifying cats, dogs, and mice in a picture. There are many reasons why mice are problematic in a home or barn. Stealing food, leaving droppings, vandalizing furniture and molding, and spreading deadly diseases just to name a few. This model could be used for detecting how many mice are in a barn, house, or yard using a cheap motion-activated camera while discerning the mice from household pets. The model could also be easily repurposed for other use cases like sending a SMS alert whenever a wolf or deer enters into a security camera frame or for pet store security cameras to prevent theft, either by customers or by cash register operators. 

The model was adapted from previous classifiers so as to identify more than two kinds of animals. We believe this early model can further be adapted to identify hundreds more than the three here. The Python code implements the TensorFlow library and is trained on thousands of cat, dog, and mouse images.
